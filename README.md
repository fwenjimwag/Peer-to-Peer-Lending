# Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Lending for Small Businesses

A blockchain-based platform connecting small businesses with lenders through smart contracts for transparent, efficient, and accessible financing.

## Overview

This decentralized application (DApp) enables small businesses to access funding directly from individual and institutional lenders without traditional banking intermediaries. Smart contracts automate loan origination, risk assessment, fund distribution, and repayment processes.

## Architecture

The platform consists of four main smart contract components:

1. **Loan Request Contract:** Manages loan applications from businesses
    - Handles business profile creation and verification
    - Standardizes loan application parameters (amount, term, purpose)
    - Manages application statuses and funding progress
    - Stores business documentation (hashed/encrypted)

2. **Lender Contract:** Handles lender investments and portfolio management
    - Facilitates deposit of lending capital
    - Manages lender profiles and risk preferences
    - Enables portfolio diversification across multiple loans
    - Tracks investment returns and performance

3. **Risk Assessment Contract:** Evaluates loan risk and sets interest rates
    - Analyzes business financial data and creditworthiness
    - Implements algorithmic risk scoring
    - Determines appropriate interest rates based on risk profile
    - Provides transparency into scoring methodology

4. **Repayment Contract:** Manages loan repayments and defaults
    - Automates scheduled repayment collection
    - Handles early repayment scenarios and fees
    - Manages default procedures and collateral liquidation
    - Distributes repayments to lenders proportionally

## Features

- **Direct Financing:** Connects businesses and lenders without intermediaries
- **Transparent Terms:** All loan terms and conditions are immutable and visible on-chain
- **Algorithmic Assessment:** Objective risk evaluation based on predefined criteria
- **Fractional Lending:** Lenders can participate with varying amounts in the same loan
- **Automated Execution:** Smart contracts handle disbursements and collections
- **Global Accessibility:** Available to underserved businesses worldwide
- **Reduced Costs:** Lower fees compared to traditional financial institutions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- ETH for gas fees
- Stablecoin (USDC, DAI) for lending/borrowing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentral-p2p-lending.git
   cd decentral-p2p-lending
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Run local development environment
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Deploy to testnet
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
   ```

2. Verify contracts on Etherscan
   ```
   npx hardhat verify --network goerli DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
   ```

## Usage

### For Businesses

1. Create verified business profile
2. Submit loan application with required documentation
3. Receive funding when loan is fully subscribed
4. Make scheduled repayments through the platform

### For Lenders

1. Register and complete KYC/AML verification
2. Deposit funds into lender contract
3. Browse loan applications and invest based on risk preferences
4. Receive repayments and track portfolio performance

## Security Considerations

- **Smart Contract Audits:** All contracts audited by [Audit Firm]
- **Escrow Protection:** Funds held in escrow until loan terms are met
- **Decentralized Identity:** Verifiable credentials for KYC/KYB
- **Insurance Fund:** Buffer against defaults for lender protection
- **Gradual Rollout:** Phased approach with lending limits

## Roadmap

- **Q2 2023:** Launch on testnet with basic functionality
- **Q3 2023:** Mainnet launch with stablecoin lending
- **Q4 2023:** Implement credit delegation and yield farming for lenders
- **Q1 2024:** Add cross-chain functionality for multiple blockchains
- **Q2 2024:** Introduce governance token and DAO for platform management
- **Q3 2024:** Develop secondary market for loan trading

## Regulatory Compliance

The platform implements several features to ensure regulatory compliance:
- KYC/AML verification for all participants
- Jurisdictional restrictions based on local regulations
- Transparency reporting for tax purposes
- Data privacy controls compliant with GDPR and similar regulations
